# Understanding Society Data Cleaning

<!-- badges: start -->

state and is being actively

## Motivation

The motivation for `ukhlsclean` is to develop a set of standard
functions for processing raw data from the UK Household Longitudinal
Study, also known as Understanding Society, which is an ongoing
longitudinal survey of individuals and households representative of the
UK population. The survey collects a wide variety of demographic,
behavioural, health, and labour market information.

## Usage

The `ukhlsclean` package contains functions which read in the raw data
files, process them into clean output variables, and combines all data
files into a single output data table. The functions also create
real-terms values for nominally valued monetary variables (earnings and
wages), allowing the user to select either the CPIH or RPI.

The **inputs** are the raw LFS data files obtained from the [UK Data
Service](https://ukdataservice.ac.uk/). These must be the tab delimited
versions of the data, **not Stata or SPSS**, and must be placed together
in a single directory.

A typical workflow for using the package looks as follows, with the read
data function for each individual year contained within a global
cleaning function which applies each cleaning function in turn. The
collection of global cleaning functions for each year are then wrapped
in a function to combine years of data.

``` r
#####################
### Define arguments 

root <- "C:/"
file <- "Documents/Datasets/UKHLS/tab"
waves <- 1:11
ages <- 16:89
keep_vars <- NULL
complete_vars <- NULL

########################
### Read in and combine waves of USoc data

data <- ukhlsclean(root = root,
                   file = file,
                   waves = waves,
                   ages = ages,
                   keep_vars = keep_vars,
                   complete_vars = complete_vars)
```

The **output** of these functions are a single data table of processed
LFS data

### Projects

Some examples of projects making use of the `ukhlsclean` package are:

1.  [Smoking, drinking, and work
    outcomes](https://gitlab.com/SPECTRUM_Sheffield/projects/work-productivity).
    Here the package is used to create a clean longitudinal dataset of
    smoking and drinking behaviours, labour market outcomes, and the
    covariates needed to model labour market outcomes.

## Installation

`ukhlsclean` is currently available only to members of the project team.
To access you need to [sign-up for a GitLab
account](https://gitlab.com/). You will then need to be added to the
SPECTRUM project team to gain access. If you are on a Windows machine
you will also need to [install
Rtools](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/installr/versions/0.22.0/topics/install.Rtools).  
Once that is sorted, you can install the latest version or a specified
version from GitLab with:

``` r
#install.packages("devtools")
#install.packages("getPass")
#install.packages("git2r")

devtools::install_git(
  "https://gitlab.com/stapm/r-packages/ukhlsclean.git", 
  credentials = git2r::cred_user_pass("uname", getPass::getPass()),
  ref = "x.x.x",
  build_vignettes = FALSE
)

# Where uname is your Gitlab user name.
# ref is the version you want to install - remove for the latest version
# this should make a box pop up where you enter your GitLab password
```
